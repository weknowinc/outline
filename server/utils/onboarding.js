  `# Welcome to Outline

Outline is a place for your team to build your knowledge base. This can include:

* Team wiki
* Documentation
* Playbooks
* Employee onboarding
* ...or anything you can think of

## üñã A powerful editor

Outline's editor lets you easily format your documents with keyboard shortcuts, Markdown syntax or by simply highlighting the text and making your selections. To add images, just drag and drop them to your canvas.

## üë©‚Äçüíª Developer friendly

Outline features an [API](https://www.getoutline.com/developers) for programatic document creation. To create your first document using the API, simply write it in Markdown and make a call to add it into your collection:

\`\`\`
const newDocument = {
  title: 'Getting started with codebase',
  text: 'All the information needed in Markdown',
  collectionId: '${collectionId}',
  token: 'API_KEY', // Replace with a value from https://www.getoutline.com/settings/tokens
};

fetch('https://www.getoutline.com/api/documents.create', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(newDocument),
});
\`\`\`
